    <p class="aboutMe">Welcome to the TruView Podcast and thank you for stopping by the About Us page!<br> My name is Anthony Yermolov, and I am the host of this podcast.
      I am a senior at <br>Penn State Abington and will be graduating spring 2023 with a Bachleor of Science<br> in Finance and a Minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. In my free time, I enjoy <br>to play baseball, go bowling, play chess, and hang out with friends. My passion for<br> entrepeneurship and sharing eye opening thoughts is what inspired me to start this<br> podcast.
      My goal with The TruView Podcast is to present my thoughts and learn as<br> much as I can while speaking on different topics. I have always loved doing things<br> for myself and throwing myself into projects. Because of this, I will be working hard<br> to accomplish the goal I have set for myself.
      On this podcast, you can expect views<br> and opinions from regular people. I will be discussing relevant world topics and<br> experiences that I have gone through and will be inviting guests to share their views<br> on these topics. I am committed to bringing you the best content possible<br> (even though it is not great yet), and am excited to see the improvment I will make on <br>this journey.</p>
