    <p>You and 99 other people are in a room together <br>
        You know they are there but you can't see or talk<br> to them
        Now into the room walks 2 people 
        These <br>2 people are there to present their own truths to <br>everyone but they break it up into sections
        So one <br>of them will talk to you and 49 other people first <br>while the other person will talk to the other 50<br>
        After each person is done speaking to<br> their people they will switch and present<br> their truth to the other group 
        Both of these people<br> are presenting you with a topic you know <br>absolutley nothing about meaning you have never<br> heard of it and have no previous understanding of it.<br>
        Now the question is. 
        Who do you trust?
        <br>Which truth will you choose to believe?</p>

        <h2 id="title2">Life with AI</h2>
        <p>The evolution of AI (Artificial Intelligence) has been a fascinating journey<br> that has spanned over several decades. The history<br> of AI dates back to the 1950s when the first AI programs <br>were developed. Initially, AI was seen as a way to<br> automate routine tasks, and the primary goal<br> was to create machines that could perform<br> these tasks more efficiently than humans. <br>Over time, the development of AI technology became more <br>advanced, and AI began to evolve beyond just automation. <br>Researchers began to explore the possibility <br>of creating machines that could learn<br> and adapt to new situations. This led to<br> the development of Machine Learning, which<br> is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data.<br> -Written with ChatGPT</p>
