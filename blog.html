    <h2 id="title1">Trust and Indoctrination</h2>
    <p>You and 99 other people are in a room together <br>
        You know they are there but you can't see or talk to them<br>
        Now into the room walks 2 people <br>
        These 2 people are there to present their own truths to everyone<br> but they break it up into sections<br>
        So one of them will talk to you and 49 other people first<br> while the other person will talk to the other 50<br>
        After each person is done speaking to their people<br> they will switch and present their truth to the other group <br>
        Both of these people are presenting you with a topic you know absolutley<br> nothing about meaning you have never<br> heard of it and have no previous understanding of it.
        Now the question is. <br>
        Who do you trust?<br>
        Which truth will you choose to believe?</p>
